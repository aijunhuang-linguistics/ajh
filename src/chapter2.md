## Projects in Progress

- **Title: Building the First Lifespan Corpus of Mandarin Chinese: Acquisition and Attrition**

  **Description:** This project aims to establish the first longitudinal corpus of Mandarin Chinese spanning the entire human lifespan. Using parallel behavioral methods (narrative production, picture choice comprehension), we are collecting data from a robust sample of 121 children (3-7 years), 20 young adults, and 71 older adults (60-85 years), with the same children and elderly participants re-tested at 6-8 month and 1-year intervals, respectively. This unique design will create a foundational dataset for tracking developmental and aging trajectories. The first wave of data collection is complete; longitudinal follow-up and corpus annotation are in progress. Manuscripts from the initial cross-sectional findings are in preparation.

- **Title: Acquisition and Attrition of Non-Canonical Word Orders in Mandarin Chinese**

  **Description:** This experimental project investigates the acquisition (L1, L2) and attrition of non-canonical word orders in Mandarin (including SOV, OSV, and BA/BEI constructions) across the lifespan and in bilingualism. Employing a Syntactic Priming task (production) and a Truth Value Judgment Task (comprehension), we compare native child acquirers, elderly adults (potential L1 attriters) and L2 learners. The goal is to identify the morpho-syntactic and pragmatic factors governing the stability and vulnerability of grammatical representations. L1 Production data collection is complete, and a manuscript is in preparation. Production testing for the L2 learners and elderly adults is in progress. Meanwhile, the comprehension experiment is ready for launch.

- **Title: L1 and L2 Acquisition of Mandarin verb copying structure**

  **Description:** This project investigates the acquisition of the Mandarin verb copying structure by native (L1) children and adult second-language (L2) learners, focusing on how verbal semantics constrains its use. The study uses a Truth Value Judgment Task to assess the interpretive comprehension of the structure with verbs from different semantic classes, and a Syntactic Priming paradigm to elicit its production and test for abstract, semantically conditioned syntactic representations. The central aim is to determine how the inherent meaning of a verb (e.g., causitivity) guides and predicts the developmental pathway for mastering this complex syntactic operation across both populations of learners. The experimental component is ready to launch.

- **Title: Mind, Language, and Narrative: A Training Study in Child Development**

  **Description:** This project investigated the relationship between language input, Theory of Mind (ToM), and narrative development in typically developing 4- to 6-year-old Mandarin-speaking children. Utilizing a pretest-training-posttest design, the study examined the effects of targeted mental state verb input and direct ToM reasoning training on children’s narrative production and comprehension, assessed via the Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives (MAIN). The research involved designing and implementing controlled training protocols, managing participant groups, and conducting detailed analyses of narrative macrostructure, internal state term usage, and ToM task performance. Findings will contribute to understanding the distinct and interactive roles of linguistic input and socio-cognitive training in fostering narrative competence, highlighting implications for early childhood education and language assessment.
